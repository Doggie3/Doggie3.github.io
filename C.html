<h2>
Unicycling used to be something you'd only see specially trained entertainers orcircus performers do, but now people of all ages are learning it as an interesting streetsport - or just a quick way of getting around.
</h2>
<h3>
How do I get started?
</h3>
Buy a unicycle online for about 50 dollars. You can watch a teaching video, read the guidingbook and teach yourself or join an after-school club to learn how to ride it. Practise somewherewith a longwall, like a school playground or corridor.
</p>
<h3>
What if l fall off?
</h3>
<p>
You'll usually just land on your feet as the unicycle falls over. If you fall off the front, it'sprobably because you're not pedaling enough. If you fall off the back, you're probablyleaning too far back.
</p>
<h3>
How long does it take to learn?
</h3>
<p>
It usually takes several weeks ofregular practice before you can ride it.

“When I was eight, I taught myself how to ride unicycle, because I like a challenge! Amonth later, I'd got it. I'd ride my unicycle next to mum as she walked the dog, and ride it toschool. Then I moved on to a higher one (it's 1.6 metres). My tips are to use your arms and head tokeep balance, and shoulders to steer, If you look down, you'll go down! Like riding any bike -once you've learnt it, you'll never forget. It's a challenge and something a bit different to try, andas one unicyclist put it, it's not like any other cycling - it feels like flying!’
